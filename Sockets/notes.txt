htonl is used while sending to network
ntohl when receiving

unsigned long long int strtoull(const char* str, char** endPtr, int base);
	strtoull is endian safe for numbers smaller than ULONG_MAX (32 bits machines!)
	endPtr is pointer to character pointer. On success it points to first character after number otherwise points to NULL.

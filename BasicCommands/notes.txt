Note : pingâ€™s  -R(recourd route) option will print the complete path through which the packet goes.

nmap
-sS option and many others do not log into host's records as they are not sent ack.
 /24 in range means fix first 24 bits.

arp
Entries in the ARP table can be static; created by manual configuration or dynamic; created automatically by the normal operation of the protocol. Static entries remain in the table forever and are not timed out.

/proc interfaces
   ARP supports a range of /proc interfaces to configure parameters  on  a
   global  or  per-interface  basis.   The  interfaces  can be accessed by
   reading  or  writing  the  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/*  files.    Each
   interface    in    the    system    has    its    own    directory   in
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/.  The setting in the "default"  directory  is
   used  for all newly created devices.  Unless otherwise specified, time-
   related interfaces are specified in seconds.

gc_interval (since Linux 2.2)
              How frequently the garbage collector for neighbor entries should
              attempt to run.  Defaults to 30 seconds.


gc_stale_time (since Linux 2.2)
      Determines how often to check for stale neighbor entries.   When
      a  neighbor  entry  is  considered  stale,  it is resolved again
      before sending data to it.  Defaults to 60 seconds.

gc_thresh1 (since Linux 2.2)
          The minimum number of entries to keep in  the  ARP  cache.   The
          garbage  collector  will  not  run  if there are fewer than this
          number of entries in the cache.  Defaults to 128.












------ TOOLBOX -------
More off subl - bookmark lines!
	Combine it with multi cursor
	http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/sublime-text-bookmarks.html	
	Area selector - to make tables from multilines!

Great tool in bash scripts, especially cron-
notify-send --icon=/home/udayraj/Pictures/cat.jpeg "Title" "Message"
when running the command locally from cron, 
DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/notify-send "TITLE" "MESSAGE"


watch -d=cumulative hightlights character level-changes, for line level changes-
while true; do p1=$p2; p2=$(clear; arp -ne);  dwdiff -y "\010" -1 -c <(echo "$p1") <(echo "$p2"); sleep 2; done
